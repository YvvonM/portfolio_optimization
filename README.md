# Stock Analysis Dashboard

This Streamlit application provides an interactive dashboard to analyze the historical performance of selected stocks.

## Features

- **Stock Price Visualization**: Line plots showing adjusted close prices over a selected time period.
- **Moving Averages**: Visualization of short-term and long-term moving averages for each selected stock.
- **Volume Traded**: Bar charts displaying the volume of stocks traded over time.
- **Daily Returns Distribution**: Histograms representing the distribution of daily returns for each stock.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap showing the correlation between the daily returns of the selected stocks.
- **Expected Returns and Volatility**: Table displaying the annualized expected returns and volatility of each stock.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
